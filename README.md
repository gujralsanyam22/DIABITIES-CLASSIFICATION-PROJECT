# DIABITIES-CLASSIFICATION-PROJECT
Predict whether a patient has diabetes.  This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.  I conducted a brief exploratory data analysis then ran three models: logistic regression, linear SVC and gradient boosting classification.
